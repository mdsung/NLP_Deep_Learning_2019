It’s the “memory” of the network. $s_t$ is calculated based on the previous hidden state and the input at the current step: $s_t=f(U{x_t} + Ws_{t-1})$. The function f usually is a nonlinearity such as tanh or ReLU.  $s_{-1}$, which is required to calculate the first hidden state, is typically initialized to all zeroes.\n",
    "#### * $o_t$ is the output at step t. For example, if we wanted to predict the next word in a sentence it would be a vector of probabilities across our vocabulary. $o_t = \\mathrm{softmax}(Vs_t)$.\n",
